I am attempting to use cert-manager to create and manage the cluster certificates for an openshift cluster and I am running into an issue with the locality of the secrets. 

Steps (all successful): 
1. Install cert-manager
2. Created `ClusterIssuer` with DNS01 challenge using Cloudflare 
3. Create cluster `Certificate` with wildcard cert

```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-cluster-certificate
  namespace: openshift-config
spec:
  commonName: "*.apps.ocp.snimmo.com"
  dnsNames:
    - "*.apps.ocp.snimmo.com"
  issuerRef:
    group: cert-manager.io
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    name: letsencrypt-staging-cluster-issuer
  secretName: letsencrypt-tls
```

Here's where the issue starts. I need to patch two objects: the `proxy/cluster` object which is a cluster-scoped object (no namespace) AND the `ingresscontroller.operator default` which is located in the `openshift-ingress-operator` namespace but the reference to the secret name is in another namespace (openshift-config).

Would someone recommend a solution? I was thinking that the ClusterSecret operator might be the solution for this. https://clustersecret.io

oc create configmap custom-ca2 --from-file=ca-bundle.crt=/etc/letsencrypt/live/apps.ocp.snimmo.com/fullchain.pem -n openshift-config

oc patch proxy/cluster --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"trustedCA":{"name":"custom-ca"}}}'
oc patch ingresscontroller.operator default --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultCertificate": {"name": "letsencrypt-tls"}}}' -n openshift-ingress-operator

oc edit ingresscontroller.operator default -n openshift-ingress-operator
